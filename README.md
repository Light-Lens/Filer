# Filer
Filer is an Open-Source File Encryption and Decryption Program.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one), Filer is officially completed and tested, so it is completely safe and easy to use.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Filer`.

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.<br />
- Python (Pygame, Colorama)
- Git-bash
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### Why To Use
This is a really good question, nowadays File Encrypters and Decrypters have a lot of features so they have a bit hard to understand UI(User-Interface), but it is not with Filer. Filer doesn't provide all those featurse that all others do but it has a really clean looking UI, also Filer is just very good because by modifying the source code you can change the Encryption and Decryption keys which will make your Encrypted File more secure because you only know your modified Encrypting key.

### How to Use
Go to `https://github.com/Light-Lens/Filer` and open click on `Releases` then download the latest version from there and enjoy using Filer :)
