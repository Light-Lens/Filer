# Filer
Filer is a text encryption and decryption algorithm powered by the AND random number generator.

### ***Note: Filer is just a hobby project and is not meant to be used for any serious text encryption***

## :toolbox: Getting Started
### :bangbang: Prerequisites
You need to install the following on your machine.
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### :pencil: Getting AND
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one), Filer is officially completed and tested, so it is completely safe and easy to use.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Light-Lens/Filer`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

### :pencil: Getting Started
1. `cd Filer`
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (e.g. conda or venv):
```console
$ python -m venv .venv
$ .venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install python dependencies:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Why To Use
This is a really good question, nowadays File Encrypters and Decrypters have a lot of features so they have a bit hard to understand UI(User-Interface), but it is not with Filer. Filer doesn't provide all those featurse that all others do but it has a really clean looking UI, also Filer is just very good because by modifying the source code you can change the Encryption and Decryption keys which will make your Encrypted File more secure because you only know your modified Encrypting key.

### How to Use
Go to `https://github.com/Light-Lens/Filer` and open click on `Releases` then download the latest version from there and enjoy using Filer :)
